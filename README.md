# hello-world
Following a [GitHub tutorial](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/hello-world) to learn the basics. 

## _Branch, edit, commit, pull, merge, delete_  
**Step 1:** Create branch of main named "readme-edits". A **branch** is a copy/snapshot of main. You can make and save edits without changing the original.  

**Step 2:** Make some changes to the README file in the "readme-edits" branch of main.   

**Step 3:** Save changes. Saved changes are called **commits**. Each commit has an associated message, a short description describing the changes that were made. These commit messages capture the history of the edits that were made.   

**Step 4:** Submit a **pull request**, which proposes your branch changes to be applied to the original. Pull requests show diffs (differences) between the two branches.   

**Step 5:** Merge. After submitting a pull request, the changes need to be **merged**. After merging, the edits from your branch will be incorporated into main.   

**Step 6:** The last step after confirming the merge is to delete the branch, since it is now identical to main.   


## _Forking_  
A **fork** is a copy of an entire repository, allowing you to make your own changes without affecting the original. Two ways to use forking: 1) use someone else's project as a starting point for your own or 2) propose changes to the original project. Once you fork the original repo, you then must clone it to get the files in that repo to your local computer (otherwise it just exists on GitHub).
