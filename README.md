# hello-world
Following a GitHub tutorial to learn the basics. https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/hello-world

_Branch, edit, commit, pull, merge delete:_  
**Step 1:** Create branch of main named "readme-edits". A **branch** is a copy/snapshot of main. You can make and save edits without changing the original.  

**Step 2:** Make some changes to the README file in the "readme-edits" branch of main.   

**Step 3:** Save changes. Saved changes are called **commits**. Each commit has an associated message, a short description describing the changes that were made. These commit messages capture the history of the edits that were made.   

**Step 4:** Submit a **pull request**, which proposes your branch changes to be applied to the original. Pull requests show diffs (differences) between the two branches.   

**Step 5:** Merge. After submitting a pull request, the changes need to be **merged**. After merging, the edits from your branch will be incorporated into main.   

**Step 6:** The last step after confirming the merge is to delete the branch, since it is now identical to main.
